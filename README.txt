This program will allow a user to choose a GitHub user name to search for and then it will display the basic details of that user in a web server that it creates.  The server runs at http://127.0.0.1 on port 8081 on the local machine the program is running on.

The program is the first program I have written using NodeJS to display a webapp in a server.  Overall it is a simple program, but it is effective at performing the task it was designed to do. 

If there are any questions regarding this feel free to contact me at nickgrok@gmail.com.

All the best!!
